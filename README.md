# EECS-348 Term Project

This is the repository for the Term Project for KU EECS-348 (Software Engineering I).

## Project Description

> In this project, you will build a versatile arithmetic expression evaluator using C++. The program
> will take an arithmetic expression as input, parse it, and calculate the result according to the order
> of operations (PEMDAS). This project will help you reinforce your understanding of parsing
> techniques, data structures, and algorithm design.
