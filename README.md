# EECS-348 Term Project

This is the repository for the Term Project for KU EECS-348 (Software Engineering I).

## Project Description
> In this project, you will build a versatile arithmetic expression evaluator using C++. The program
will take an arithmetic expression as input, parse it, and calculate the result according to the order
of operations (PEMDAS). This project will help you reinforce your understanding of parsing
techniques, data structures, and algorithm design.
